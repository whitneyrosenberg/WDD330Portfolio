	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<ul>
		<h4>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 8</h4>
		<li>The <code>form.submit()</code> method will submit the form automatically.</li>
		<li>Alternately, a form can be submitted anually by the user employing a button or input element with a <code>type</code> attribute of <code>submit</code>, or even an input element with a <code>type</code> attribute of <code>image</code></li>
		<li>The <code>form.reset()</code> method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.</li>
		<li>A button with a <code>type</code> attribute of <code>reset</code> can also be used to do this without the need for additional scripting. However, they are generally considered poor usability because it is too easy to accidentally click and reset the entire form.</li>
		<li>The <code>form.action</code> property can be used to set the <code>action</code> attribute of a form so its sent toa different URL to be processed on the server.</li>
		<li>The <code>focus</code> event occurs when an element is focused on.</li>
		<li>The <code>blur</code> event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.</li>
		<li>The <code>change</code> event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it.</li>
		<li>The <code>submit</code> event occurs when the form is submitted.</li>
		<li>Text input element objects have a <code>value</code> property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.</li>
		<li>Some common types of form control are:
			<ul>
				<li><code>input</code> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads</li>
				<li><code>select</code> menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
				<li><code>textarea</code> elements for longer text entry</li>
				<li><code>button</code> elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The <code>autofocus</code> attribute gives focus to the element when a page loads.</li>
		<li>The <code>placeholder</code> attribute will insert the value provided in the input field until the user enters some text.</li>
		<li>The <code>maxlength</code> attribute will limit the number of characters that can be entered in the field to the value given</li>
		<li>It is advisable to use both client-side and server-side validation.</li>
		<h4>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 12</h4>
		<li>Encapsulation means keeing the inner workings hidden inside the object and only allowing the essential functionalities to be exposed to the end user.</li>
		<li>Polymorphism is the idea that the same process can be used for different objects. Various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
		<li>Inheritance takes an object that already exists and inherits all of its properies and methods. Then improves on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</li>
		<li>ES6 introduced the newclass declarationsyntax that does exactly the same thing as a constructor function, but looks much similar to writing a class in a class-based programming language. </li>
		<li>The <code>static</code> keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method.</li>
		<li>The <code>prototype</code> property of a class can add extra methods and properties of the class.</li>
		<li>Prototype properties are shared by every instance of the class.</li>
		<li>An object instance can overwrite any properties or methods inherited from its prototype by simply assigning a new value to them.</li>
		<li>Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.</li>
		<li>By default, an object’s methods are public in JavaScript.</li>
		<li>Properties of objects in JavaScript are said to beenumerableornon-enumerable. If they aren't enumerable, this means they will not show up when a for-in loop is used to loop through an object’s properties and methods.</li>
		<li>A class can inherit from another class using the <code>extends</code> keyword in a class declaration.</li>
		<li>Inside the child class declaration, the keyword <code>super</code> refers to the parent class, and can be used to access any properties and call any methods of the parent class.</li>
		<li>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance. It allows more complex objects to be created by ‘mixing’ basic objects together.</li>
		<li>'Composition over inheritance'. This approach advocates creating small objects that describe single tasks or behaviors and using them as the building blocks for more complex objects. </li>
		<li>A good rule of thumb is to only inherit once, keeping the inheritance chain to just two objects makes unpicking any issues far easier.</li>
		<h4>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 15</h4>
		<li>jQuery is the most popular of all the JavaScript libraries used today and has a plugin system that makes it easy to extend and use to build common web page elements.</li>
		<li>A library should not be used because of a lack of understanding of JavaScript. Instead, it should be used to speed up JavaScript development by making it easier to complete common tasks.</li>
		<li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability.</li>
		<li>There are a few important points about modules that are worth keeping in mind:
			<ul>
				<li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.</li>
				<li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.</li>
				<li>The value of <code>this</code> in the top level of a module is <code>undefined</code>, rather than the global object.</li>
				<li>You can't use HTML-style comments in modules (although this isn't very common in any JavaScript program these days).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that’s been used for a long time in server-side languages. MVC separates an application into three distinct, independent components that interact with each other:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Models</b> are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior. In a to-do list application, for example, there would be a task model providing methods to access all the information about the tasks such as names, due dates and completed tasks. This data will often be stored in a database or some other container.</li>
				<li><b>Views</b> provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information. In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a web page. Views also provide a way for users to interact with an application, usually via forms. In a to-do list application, the views would display the tasks as an HTML list with checkboxes that a user could tick to say a task had been completed.</li>
				<li><b>Controllers</b> link models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user (entering some data into a form, for example), process the information, then update the model and view accordingly. In a to-do list application, the controller functions would respond to the event of a user clicking on a check box and then inform the model that a task had been completed. The model would then update the information about that task.</li>
			</ul>
