	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<h4>Novice to Ninja - Chapter 2</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of its similarities with the C programming language.</li>
		<li>Reserved Words:
			<ul id="week2_reserved_words">
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Important, but not reserved: undefined, NaN, Infinity</li>
		<li>Prmitive Data Types:
			<ul>
				<li>String</li>
				<li>Symbol (introdcued in ES6)</li>
				<li>Number</li>
				<li>Boolean</li>
				<li>Undefined</li>
				<li>Null</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If the value isn't a primitive data type then it is an object</li>
		<li>Use const and let rather than var when declaring variables. This ensures variables are block scoped, meaning their value only exists inside the block they are declared in.</li>
		<li>Variable names that start with an underscore generally refer to private properties and methods</li>
		<li>The $ character is also used by the jQuery library.</li>
		<li>If you assign a non-primitive value to a variable, then this is done by reference, so any changes that are subsequently made will affect <i>all</i> references to that object.</li>
		<li>Use template literals (Strings with back ticks rather than quotation marks) to allow interpolation of JS code in a string.<br>
			<code>
				const name = `Whitney`;<br>
				`Hello! My name is ${ name }!`;<br>
				<< 'Hello! My name is Whitney!';
			</code>
		</li>
