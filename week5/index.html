	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<h4>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 10</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>System Error: There's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting. We have little influence over how external systems work, but we should still be aware of possible erros and attempt to reduce their impact.</li>
		<li>Programmer Error: The program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo. These are our responsibility. Minimize them as much as possible and fix them promptly.</li>
		<li>User Error: The user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle. We should try to limit these by predicting possible interactions and deal with them in a way that doesn't negatively impact the user experience.</li>
		<li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</li>
		<li>A stack trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</li>
		<li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.</li>
		<li>A programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly. In production, a programmer should try to make the code fail gracefully (although not completely silently ― we still need to know there’s an error), so the user experience is not affected, if possible.</li>
		<li>Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. To use strict mode, add the line <code>'use strict';</code> to your JavaScript file or functions.</li>
		<li>JavaScript modules are in strict mode by default so the declarations is not required.</li>
		<li>Linting tools can be used to test the quality and consistencty of JavaScript code.</li>
		<li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</li>
		<li>The most basic form of debugging is to use the <code>alert()</code> method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because <code>alert()</code> stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be.</li>
		<li>One of the most useful commands is the <code>debugger</code> keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.</li>
		<li>Remember to remove any references to the <code>debugger</code> command before shipping any code, otherwise the program will appear to freeze when people try to use it!</li>
		<li>An <code>error</code> object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function.</li>
		<li>It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, but still identified. We can then deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the program running.</li>
		<li>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.</li>
		<li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. Obviously these tests will initially fail, because there is no code to test. The next step is to write some code to make the tests pass.</li>
